PhD student at University of California, San Diego. Advised by the great Dan Fu. Curious about parallel microarchitecture and developing scalable, efficient machine-learning architectures and tools. Slowly updating my hidden state by researching structured sparsity, retrieval, and state space models.

Previously did my undergraduate at UT Austin studying ECE. I worked with Prof. Sujay Sanghavi on a variety of core ML problems and some problems intersecting ML and systems.

Summer 2025 Plans:
 - Working through Stanford's CS 336 Class
 - Building Tlib (A library bringin einstein notation and fuller frontend to triton lang)
 - Starting some research on recurrent depth language models (Very cool things to come...)
